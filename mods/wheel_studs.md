# Wheel studs

The OEM wheel studs are known to be made of low quality metal, and are prone to
seizing or breaking threads. When one of the wheel stud fails, it's recommended
to replace all five studs on that corner of the car.

## Direct replacements

ARP 100-7727 is a direct replacement for OEM studs and is known to be much more
durable.

## Extended replacements

ARP also provides the following extended studs:
* ARP 100-7729 has ~15 mm more thread than OEM and an acorn tip
* ARP 100-7716 ass ~22 mm more thread than OEM and an acorn tip

Due to the extra length and an acorn tip it's typically necessary to use open
ended lug nuts with these studs.

An untested but promising alternative is a
`Eibach PRO-SPACER Kit 5x100 10mm S90-6-10-003` kit that comes with OEM-style
wheel studs that are ~8 mm more thread than OEM. Those studs are designed to be
used with the spacers that they come with, and will likely bottom out the OEM
lug nuts when used without the spacers. However, it appears that with deeper
closed end lug nuts such as Muteki 41885C you should still be able to use these
studs even without spacers. (Of course there's no issue with open ended lug
nuts). So a possible strategy is to get deep lug nuts, ARP 100-7727 for the rear
hubs, and this Eibach kit for the front if you only ever want to run spacers no
thicker than 10 mm.
