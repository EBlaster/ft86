# Aftermarket anti-roll bars

Below is my catalog of aftermarket anti-roll bars (also known as ARBs, sway
bars, "sways").

The numbers were calculated based on the manufacturer's claims such as "+123%
stiffness compared to stock (2013-2016 OEM bar)". Please let me know if you can
find more trustworthy numbers!

Each list is ordered roughly from the softest to stiffest options.

## Front anti-roll bars

## Rear anti-roll bars
